			<h1>Hello, welcome to my odd mind. <h4>tik tok, apple sauce.</h4></h1>
			<p>
				In the 2020's we were/are all expected to have some sort of blog where we share things we like. 
				Most of those things should be about work, software, and/or artifical intelligence.
				Right now the hunt is on for artificial general intelligence, AGI, that coul make our books,
				movies, and tv shows so we can all become Wall-E like or do what we please.
				How that works out only time will tell. In better news you should head to the <a href="/blog">the blog.</a>

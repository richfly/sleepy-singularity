## Forecasting Scenarios

When building any product, whether it's software or a physical item, numerous financial considerations are crucial. This involves creating financial
scenarios using tools like spreadsheets, Python, and other available resources. The specific methods and considerations vary depending on the product
being sold. It's also essential to understand and articulate the assumptions behind each scenario, along with the risks associated with these assumptions.

### First we want to start with our scenarios

First I like to create a table that has standard and specific scenarios, _we will generalize our scenarios for this article_, to our organizational goals for example;

| Scenario      |
| ------------- |
| Base Case     |
| Optimistic    |
| Pessisimistic |
| New Product   |
| New Service   |
| Expansion     |
| Cost Cutting  |

<br />

This provides a base for us to begin to discuss what each scenario entails and can come to agreement on. The base case, optiimistic, and pessimistic, account
for little to no changes of you offering as compared to the other options of your scenarios.

### Add Key Assumptions

Now we can add our assumptions and short explanation. This in an initial document should be short and concise with 3-4 bullet points for the audience and if
needed you make a slide deck for the larger audience.

<br />

Now that we have our assumptions listed and scenarios we can add our revenue costs and profits. _For this example we will simplified examples_.

### Revenue, Costs, Net profits

The following table will hold our revenues, costs, and profit scenarios.

We can see our scenarios. How did we calculate these and come up with the values. How do we determine our ratios for each and the cost benefit of each.
While expansion is costly and low profit in the beginning could it still be beneficial as part of the organizations long term strategy. This where a larger
document of outcomes and sensitivities can come into play. Check back next week for sensitivity analysis.

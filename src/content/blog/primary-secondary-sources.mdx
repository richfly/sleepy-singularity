# What I wanted to write vs what I did

I wanted to write something insightful today and thought about it and thought about. I thought about it when I woke up in the morning,
while I was brushing my teeth, while I was drinking my coffee, while I worked on other tasks after realizing I was drawing a blank on
the topic I actually wanted to write about. I ate lunch and thought about it. I tried getting over the block using multiple AI's some
on hugging face, locally on LMStudio, locally with ComfyUI, and even GPT4. What I wanted to write about just wasn't meant to be today
but this is my new goal. To write more regularly. So if you are out there reading this and feel blocked. It happens.

## Just keep trying

I kept trying to find the words the topic the discussion I needed to have to unblock what I was thinking and wanting to write about. well
here's to tomorrow.

FAQs:

What is market research?
Market research is the process of gathering, analyzing, and interpreting information about a market, about a product or service offered for sale in
that market, and about the past, present, and potential future customers for the marketer's product or service. Market research can be conducted using
both primary and secondary research methods.

Why is market research important?
Market research is important because it helps businesses make informed strategic decisions based on accurate and reliable information
about their target markets, their competitors, and their potential and existing customers. Market research can help businesses identify
new opportunities for growth, improve customer satisfaction by understanding and addressing their needs and preferences, and stay competitive
in their respective markets by keeping up with the latest trends, developments, and innovations within their industries.

What are the differences between primary and secondary research methods?
Primary research is original research that is conducted specifically for a particular business purpose or objective. Primary research methods
include surveys, interviews, focus groups, observation, and experimentation. Primary research data is typically considered more reliable and
accurate than secondary research data because it is collected directly from the source rather than being derived from existing sources.

Secondary research is research that has already been conducted by other organizations or individuals for a particular business purpose or objective.
Secondary research methods include literature reviews, industry reports, government publications, academic journals, trade associations, and commercial
databases. Secondary research data is typically considered less reliable and accurate than primary research data because it is derived from existing
sources rather than being collected directly from the source. However, secondary research can be a valuable source of information for businesses because
it can provide insights into industry trends, market size and growth, customer demographics and psychographics, competitive landscape, and regulatory environment.
Furthermore, secondary research can also serve as a starting point or foundation for primary research, helping businesses to identify key research
questions, target audiences, and data sources for their primary research efforts.

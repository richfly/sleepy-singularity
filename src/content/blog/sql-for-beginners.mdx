## Format of SQL

SQL is a structured query language, so it has as stated a structure that you can learn and use to create queries. The beginning of the structure is laid out below;

```sql
select column1
    , column2
    , column3
from table
/*
think of a table like a
sheet in google sheets or excel
*/
```

<br />
![example sheet](/blog-spreadsheet.jpeg "sheet")

<br />
So what we did in the above if this was excel or google sheets is specified the columns
and the sheet as if we had multiple sheets. This allows us to only see the data we
want from that sheet and not copy it all. In the below we would be copying everything
from the sheet.

```sql
select * --the star is kind of like a select all
from table
```

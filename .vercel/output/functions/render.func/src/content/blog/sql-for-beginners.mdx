# SQL, Structured Query Language

SQL, is the language of databases and a powerful way to learn about your products users. There are numerous places to start with SQL and ways to understand it.
At the bottom of this post in the <a href="#learn">"Places to Learn and Practice"</a> section I provided a few sites to check out.

## Format of SQL

SQL is a structured query language, so it has as stated a structure that you can learn and use to create queries. The beginning of the structure is laid out below;

```sql
select column1
    , column2
    , column3
from table
/*
think of a table like a
sheet in google sheets or excel
*/
```

<br />
![example sheet](/blog-spreadsheet.jpeg "sheet")

<br />
So what we did in the above if this was excel or google sheets is specified the columns
and the sheet as if we had multiple sheets. This allows us to only see the data we
want from that sheet and not copy it all. In the below we would be copying everything
from the sheet.

```sql
select * --the star is kind of like a select all
from table
```

## SUM() questions of the data ðŸ˜¹

Now that isn't very helpful so some of what we want to do is determine a question. So for instance lets say, "**What is the total for the bids?**".

Now what we do is start using a SQL Function or Keyword. The SUM keyword can be used on a specific column. Like below;

```sql
SELECT column1
    , SUM(column2)
    , column3
FROM table
```

<br />

This doesn't seem to give us the right answers because we still have everything that isn't bids. So we need to add another keyword. The `WHERE` clause
this allows us to specify specific conditions that need to be met. Like `column4 = 'bid'`. This allows us to drill down.

<br />

```sql
SELECT column1
    , SUM(column2)
    , column3
FROM table
WHERE column4 = 'bid'
```

<br />

Now that we have the bids we still have multiple columns and not just the answer. This part we can do two ways. We will first solve the original question, "**What is the total for the bids?**".
To do this we can just remove the other columns from the query. This will give us the sum of total bids.

<br />

```sql
SELECT SUM(column2)
FROM table
WHERE column4 = 'bid'
```

<br />

This gives us the answer for the bids on the table of 14,776,258. Now say we want to take this and be able to know column 5 which we can call the user initials
and we can actually rename both columns with what are known as aliases!

<br />

### The secret alias for readability

In SQL to make tables and data more readable we often use aliases. This is like adding headers on sheets or excel. Its as easy as just writing
what you want to name it after, _but naming ain't always easy_. You can choose but it is best practice for readability to use the `as` keyword. For example `SELECT SUM(column2) as Total_Value`.
This names the column, provides detail, and lets you and anyone else who needs this query what the name is and where it came from.
As queries get longer this becomes more important.

So to get our final answer with some added readability we get;

```sql
SELECT SUM(column2) as Total_Value
FROM table
WHERE column4 = 'bid'
```

<br />

Now let's say column 5 is users how would we get the users total by bid. Check back December 18th 2023 as we continue that lesson -- <a href='/sql-for-beginner-2'>Grouping and more</a>.
